's sequence . wilder , having just made the ultra-noir double indemnity , brought a new kind of frankness and darkness to hollywood 's treatment of a social problem . at first the film may have seemed too bold ; paramount pictures nearly killed the release of the picture after it tested poorly with preview audiences . but once in release , the lost weekend became a substantial hit , and won four oscars : for picture , director , screenplay , and actor . -- robert horton\",\n",
